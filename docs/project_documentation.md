# Project Documentation
## Initial Goal
Initially this repo was created to create a virtual self-driving agent based purely on Vision by using a classic CNN approach. It was decided to test this on the gamejam game "[Driving Nightmare](https://misterixi.itch.io/driving-nightmare)", since I worked on this game myself and could freely adjust the game to my needs.  
### CNN
As a "normal" CNN, the network was created with a simple convolutional neural network with tensorflow.
