Next Steps:
- [X] sanity check: implement a viewer that picks random training data and shows the prediction of the model
- [ ] change inputs from floats to buckets: left, middle, right. Or e.g. 20
    - crossentropy loss
    - onehot vector
- [ ] implement reinformcement learning
    - policy gradient
    - q value
    - actor critic (2. model that evaluates the player)
